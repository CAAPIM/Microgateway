- If you get an error `Server aborted the SSL handshake`, wait 30 seconds to 1 minute for the ssg container to launch.

- If you get an error `Failed to connect to otk.mycompany.com port 8443: Connection refused Failed at line X`, then try these commands to remove orphaned containers.

  ```
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml down --volumes
  ```
  
  And try this again:

  ```
  docker-compose up --build
  ```

- If you get an error `Failed to connect to localhost port 443: Connection refused`, then check if `dockercompose_proxy_1` container is running by:
  
  ```
  docker-compose ps
  ```
  
  To run the proxy container, run the following command from get-started/docker-comose directory:
  
  ```
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dockercloudproxy.yml up -d --build
  ```

- If you get `Failed to connect to localhost port 8443: Connection refused`, make sure `otk_otk_1` container is running by:

  ```
  docker-compose ps
  ```

  If the otk container is not running, move to `get-started/external/otk` directory and run:

  ```
  docker-compose up --build â€“d
  ```

  You should now be able to acces https://localhost:8443/oauth/manager.
