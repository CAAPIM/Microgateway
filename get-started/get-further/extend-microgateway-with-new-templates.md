## Extend Microgateway with new templates
The Quick Start Solution may be extended by importing RESTMAN bundles on startup. This allows us and customers to mix-and-match solutions that they intend to use with the Gateway, producing a smaller, purpose-tailored image.

_Template design functionality is limited to CA customers who have signed up for trial and downloaded Microgateway Policy Manager. 

Note: the Policy Manager 9.2.09 download is available in the [free trial version](https://www.ca.com/us/trials/ca-microgateway.html).
