## Extend Microgateway with new templates
The Quick Start Solution may be extended by importing RESTMAN bundles on startup. This allows us and customers to mix-and-match solutions that they intend to use with the Gateway, producing a smaller, purpose-tailored image.

* Policy template design functionality requires the Policy Manager, which is available for download [here](https://www-qa.ca.com/us/trials/ca-microgateway.html) (requires trial sign up).
